# Repository for the Learning in Artificial and Biological Neuronal Networks lecture at ETH (Fall semester 2021)


You'll find in this repository a set of flashcards I prepared for the Learning in Artificial and Biological Neural Networks exam. The questions and answers found in these flashcards are in large part derived from the brilliant summary written by Nik Dennler in 2019, and the summary written by Danilo Djordjevic in Fall 2021.  

The Fall 2021 exam followed a multiple-choice format with two sections: the first section included questions with a single correct answer, the second section with multiple correct answers. 

In order to use these flashcards, you need to have the Anki Flashcard App installed on your desktop, which you can download here: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
Information on how to import decks onto ankiweb can be found here: https://docs.ankiweb.net/importing.html

Best of luck,

Kevin
